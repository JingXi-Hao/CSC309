Features Implemented:

1. After clicking the 'Menu' button at the navigation bar, the position for the profile
   information section and profile feed section are moved downward in order to prevent
   from covering by the expanded navigation bar. These two sections are also moved
   upward when the partial navigation bar is hidden.
   
2. When the screen size is less than 480px, the profile information section and the 
   profile feed section are located vertically. When the screen size is greater than or
   equal to 480px, the profile information section and the profile feed section are
   located horizontally, each section takes half of the screen. Also, when the screen size
   is greater than or equal to 1280px, the 'Menu' button is invisible and the full
   navigation links are being visible; in addition, the personal information and the 
   profile photo are located horizontally in this case.

   responsive. Also, the text posted is automatically broken for too long word.
